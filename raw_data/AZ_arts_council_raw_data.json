        "description": "Nuestra Herencia Grant | Latinos in Heritage Conservation\\nPosted\\nOctober 14th, 2025\\nLatinos in Heritage Conservation (LHC) is committed to supporting a strong, national movement for Latinx heritage preservation. To further this mission, we offer the Nuestra Herencia Grant Program, which is exclusively dedicated to funding Latinx heritage and historic preservation projects. With $600,000 in annual funding, this initiative empowers grassroots, Latinx-focused nonprofit organizations and community groups working to protect and uplift Latinx history and cultural contributions across the United States.\\nThrough this inclusive, equity-centered grant program, LHC is committed to elevating a diverse range of projects by prioritizing organizations and communities historically left out of traditional funding opportunities. To ensure greater accessibility, we provide resources like Spanish-language application materials and personalized support so that our stories and legacies can endure for future generations.\\nThe LHC Grant Program is made possible by the generous support of the Andrew W.

Over time, Latinx communities have preserved their homelands, family stories, cultural traditions, heritage, and sacred sites, contributing to our collective legacy. Traditional Historic Preservation involves protecting historic buildings, archeology, public lands, the environment, artifacts, and cultural traditions significant in our shared history. For Latinxs and our communities, at its core, historic preservation honors and sustains elements shaping our cultural heritage, and Latinidad.\\nBorderlands Focus\\nNonprofits from across the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico are encouraged to apply. While the program is open to all, it places a special emphasis on organizations located in the Borderlands region, including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah. This region stands out for its rich tapestry of Indigenous, Mexican, and American cultural influences. Despite its pivotal role in shaping American history, preservation efforts in the Borderlands have frequently been overlooked. This program aims to change that by bringing much-needed attention and support to these communities.\\nFunding Goals\\nIn accordance with our mission to build a movement that affirms Latinx heritage through education, conservation, and leadership development, the Nuestra Herencia Grant Program prioritizes funding projects that align with the following objectives:\\nConservation of place-based history through documenting the history of buildings, landmarks, neighborhoods, communities, or cities, along with its significance to Latinx heritage and history.\\nThe physical preservation and restoration of places and spaces connected to Latinx heritage and history for public use.\\nIdentification of sites throughout the country connected to Latinx heritage history through historic context surveys, oral histories, or other methods.\\nNominating Latinx sites to local, state, and national historic registration lists to increase representation.\\nRepresentations of minoritized histories within the Latinx community, such as Afro-Latino, LGBTQIA+, and Indigenous narratives.\\nIncreasing the capacity of Latinx preservation nonprofits by supporting organizational capacity building.\\nAre You Eligible?\\nYour organization:\\n501(c)(3) nonprofit\\nThis includes preservation-focused community groups, museums, cultural centers, historic preservation groups, historic sites, historical societies, etc.\\nIf your organization does not yet have 501(c)(3) status, your project can be fiscally sponsored.\\nLatinx led and/or serving organization\\nWe do not fund local, state, tribal, or federal agencies.
