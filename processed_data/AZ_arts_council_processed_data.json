From its profound implications with collectivity, to the grief experienced when losing loved ones, death has consistently been a central question in our shared history. In Mexico, the annual festivities of Day of the Dead occur at the end of October and the beginning of November symbolizing the culmination of the maize cultivation cycle, and the temporary return of deceased relatives and beloved individuals to Earth.\\nThe Immersive Learning Program: Day of the Dead focuses on the significance of the Day of the Dead as a cornerstone of national identity, rooted in indigenous wisdom, and explores its impact on the development of Mexican modern art, as well as its transformation into a secularized element of popular culture. The program examines the performative nature of rituals in Mexico, with a particular focus on the mortuary celebrations. Within the context of this national holiday participants will engage in practical Spanish language lessons, culinary exploration, and hands-on art learning fostering a multidisciplinary approach encompassing art creation, culinary arts, and linguistic practice. Moreover, the program prompts critical inquiry into themes of eternity, nationalism, and identity, challenging preconceived notions surrounding death as a national symbol and questioning its portrayal as a morbid facet of identity construction.\\nThe Arquetopia Immersive Learning Program is a 2-week intensive experience designed to provide competitive professional opportunities for emerging and mid-career artists, curators, art historians, and students aged 20 and above from around the world. This distinctive program offers critical perspectives on the representation of death in Mexico as a foundational element of national identity. By delving into the myths surrounding its origins, the program offers participants a nuanced understanding of the Day of the Dead celebrations. Its objective is to equip participants with the analytical tools necessary to comprehend the performative nature of these rituals, exploring intricate facets such as emotional portrayals, material culture, and the evolving historical significance of death. Participants will also have the opportunity to contextualize their own artistic practices by learning papier mch techniques directly related to the creation of ofrendas (altars), which are central to the celebration of the Day of the Dead.\\nPROGRAM INCLUSIONS\\nThis 2-week program includes 8 hours of instruction in Day of the Dead ephemeral art techniques, including paper, installation, and the edible dimension of the altar; as well as an exploration of Jose Guadalupe Posadas imagery. Participants will have the opportunity to join guided tours and visits to prominent museums in Puebla, altars, graveyards, or relevant sites. Alongside these artistic endeavors, attendees will engage in 12 hours of Spanish language lessons, divided into 6 hours of grammar and 6 hours of immersive on-site language practice. They will also embark on food tours, a total of 4 hours, to savor the culinary delights of the region and spend 6 hours on academic visits to museums, altars, graveyards, and other relevant sites. Furthermore, participants will benefit from 2 hours of artistic mentoring sessions. Activities are designed to promote intense creative work and artistic dialogue; therefore, artists are expected to allocate self-directed studio hours as part of their weekly schedule. Reading materials are provided in English and workshop instruction is in Spanish.\\nStaff Support:\\nEach resident artist meets weekly with our directorial and curatorial staff for personalized mentoring, research assistance/resources, project guidance, and critique\\nAccommodation:\\nFurnished, private bedroom\\n24-hour access to the kitchen for participants to prepare their own meals; meals/food are the participants responsibility\\nWireless Internet\\nUse of Arquetopias common spaces including outdoor terraces\\nShared, serviced (single) bathrooms with modern fixtures and showers\\nHousekeeping\\nStudio Workspace:\\n24-hour access to large and bright, shared art studio with generous natural light\\nPersonal workspace with large table and wall space\\nSome tools provided\\nMaterials and supplies for the instructional course provided\\nMaterials and supplies for extended project production are not included but are available for purchase locally\\nDURATION / TIME PERIOD\\nSession is 2 weeks, October 20 to November 3, 2025.\\nArquetopia is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of our diverse local and international community.

This 3-week immersive experience brings together artists-in-residence, local students and professors, and community members, fostering an environment of interdisciplinary inquiry, experimentation, and ethical engagement. Over the past decade and a half, ArquetopiaSUMMER has grown from a critical residency into something larger: a space where knowledge, practice, and dialogue intersect in transformative ways. In the words of Audre Lorde, Without community, there is no liberation. It is this belief that has shaped the programs evolution into a festivalan intentional gathering that celebrates the collective force of learning, creating, and imagining together.\\nExpanding beyond the studio and classroom, the Metamorphosis Festival actively engages a broader public through open lectures, an exhibition, and events. These public components are designed to spark dialogue and facilitate the exchange of ideas between diverse audiences, reinforcing our commitment to inclusive education and socially engaged art practices. Through this expanded model, the festival becomes a dynamic platform for collective reflection, critical discourse, and transformative encounters across disciplines and communities.\\nOPEN LECTURES, EXHIBITION AND CULTURAL EVENTS\\nThe educational core of Metamorphosis: ArquetopiaSUMMER Festival 2025 revolves around open lectures, an exhibition, and events that highlight material culture as both context and method. These activities encourage interdisciplinary engagement and offer participants opportunities to engage with material culture in dynamic and interactive ways. Through open lectures, master classes, round tables, an exhibition and other cultural events, participants will delve into how 19th-century visual and material culture shaped ideologies of nationalism, race, class, gender and modernity. The program will explore how books, prints, illustrations, and everyday objects acted as active agents in constructing national imaginaries, empowering participants to analyze the ongoing influence of material forms on contemporary political and cultural discourse. The festivals pedagogical model fosters mutual exchange, encouraging participants to learn through teaching and collaboration. By engaging with mentors, local practitioners, students, professors, and communities, participants will explore how artistic and academic practices interact with broader social and historical dynamics. Public eventsincluding lectures, exhibitions, and dialoguesextend the festivals reach, promoting interdisciplinary exchange across diverse audiences and reaffirming Arquetopias commitment to inclusive, socially engaged education.\\nThe Metamorphosis: ArquetopiaSUMMER Festival 2025 spans three weeks across multiple venues, including BUAP (Benemrita Universidad Autnoma de Puebla), Universidad para Adultos, the Facultad de Artes Plsticas y Audiovisuales de la BUAP, and various museums in Puebla.

In this program, fellows explore key issues around expanding the canon of art history for the future of museums.\\nThe fellowship allows staff already working at a participating museum to enroll in the masters degree program in Art History at ASU. Museum employees take the classes via Zoom technology and participate in person and remotely in professional development activities.\\nFellows have access to resources at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Perez Art Museum Miami, the ASU Art Museum and ASUs Herberger Institute, the largest comprehensive design and arts school in the United States.\\nEligibility requirements\\nPotential applicants must be employed at a participating museum for a minimum of one year. In addition, applicants must fulfill\\nall admissions requirements for the MA in Art History\\ndegree.\\nProgram components\\nCoursework\\nASUs MA in art history is a comprehensive degree program designed to train students to engage with visuality in multiple ways.  A diverse curriculum fosters critical understanding of aesthetics, production, patronage and consumption of art. Ten internationally recognized faculty members offer classes covering many cultures, time periods and geographies, using multiple approaches and methodologies. The program stresses intersections between disciplines and offers focused study in the areas of images and digital technologies, art in social and political contexts, and histories and theories of visual culture. Object-based learning using museum collections is an emphasis.\\nFellows enroll in two graduate-level courses each semester. Course offerings in the curriculum include Ancient Greek and Roman, Asian, Contemporary, Global/Thematic Seminars, Latin American, Medieval, Modern and Pre-Columbian art. Future coursework is planned in American Indian, Latinx, African American, Korean, African Diaspora and Oceanica art.\\nMentorship\\nAn outside museum professional is assigned to mentor each fellow to provide individual counsel on graduate study, thesis and externship design, and ongoing career trajectory.\\nThesis requirement\\nUnder the guidance of a Thesis Committee, fellows write a thesis proposal during the second year and complete and defend their thesis in the third year. The thesis must demonstrate significant research abilities and methodological approaches.\\nLanguage requirement\\nStudents must have a reading knowledge of one research language. The selected language needs to be appropriate for the area of research concentration and must be approved by the chosen faculty mentor. The requirement can be fulfilled by passing\\nthe Graduate Foreign Language Examination\\n.

The artists must pay for their own travel as well as food and other expenditures.\\nCall Description\\nArtists have played an important role in the formation, preservation, and enjoyment of national parks. Over a century ago, by painting landscapes of the American West, artists publicized many of the natural wonders of a land little known to an eastern populace. Their body of work helped to foster appreciation for these national wonders which ultimately resulted in the establishment of many national parks. Artists interpretation of park landscapes through many types of media connects people to these special places, which is an essential part of the preservation and protection of Americas national parks.\\nAt Great Basin National Park, artists will be surrounded by the natural beauty of the Park from the 13,063-foot summit of Wheeler Peak to the depths of Lehman Caves. The Park offers the solitude of the wilderness and provides expansive and renowned dark-sky stargazing. The sights, sounds, and textures of the environment, along with uninterrupted time, offer a respite from typical daily life and provide inspiration for creative work.\\nGreat Basin National Park is very remote. The closest town is Baker which has few to no amenities. Artists will find amenities in Ely, Nevada, 60 miles away.\\nWe are selecting 4 individuals from this call. Each residence will occur in 2026. The residencies are as follows:\\nSummer residence\\nThe artist may choose a 2-3 week residency during July and August. This is a CAMPING residency. Most camping gear is provided (tent, stove, cots, camp kitchen, etc).  Artists should be familiar and confident with camping prior to applying for this residency. A campsite will be provided. The artist may choose their preferred campground within the Park. Please be aware that internet service is unavailable and public WiFi at the visitor centers is spotty.

Summer is a beautiful time within the Park, with much to explore.\\nFall residence\\nThe artist may choose a 2-3 week residency during September (camping) or November (housing). Please see CAMPING info above, and HOUSING info below. The September camping residency can take place during the Parks Astronomy Festival  a stellar event!\\nWinter residence\\nThe artist may choose a 2-3 week residency during January and February.

Washers and dryers are available and the kitchen includes major appliances (refrigerator, stove, sink) and basic utensils and dishes. The selected artist is responsible for bringing everything else they may need including all bedding. Please be aware that internet service is unavailable and there is limited public WiFi. Cell service is also limited and varies between carriers. Pets and smoking are not allowed. In winter the park is very quiet and likely to be covered with several feet of snow. A residence may choose to explore on snowshoes or cross country skis. Storms may make travel to amenities in Ely more difficult. In winter the Park is very quiet and much of the Park is covered with several feet of snow.\\nWe are selecting one\\nREGIONAL Artist-in-Residence (AIR)\\nfrom this call. The artist must live and work in Nevada or Utah and may apply for any season.\\nEach AIR will present at least one public program during their residency.

Digital portfolios will be shared with Great Basin National Park and GBNPF.\\nEach AIR will donate one physical artistic piece (if applicable), along with a digital representation of the artistic piece within one year of their residency. The donation may be displayed in the Park for up to three years, after which it will be transferred to GBNPF for unrestricted use. Each AIR will provide a deed of gift to GBNPF for donated work(s) allowing rights to both digital & physical pieces.\\nArtists will be selected based upon their ability to interpret Great Basin National Park to the public, artistic integrity, and ability to reside in a remote location (camping and/or housing).
