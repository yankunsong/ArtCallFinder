For the 25th edition, CoCA is proud to announce Joseph DeLappe as juror.\\nJoseph DeLappe, (American, b. 1963), is an artist, activist and educator, currently working in Scotland, where he is the Professor of Games and Tactical Media at Abertay University, Dundee. Working with electronic and digital media since 1983, his projects in online gaming performance, sculpture and electromechanical installation have been shown throughout the world.  Considered a pioneer in the critical and creative engagement of video games, performance, activism and community-based practices, DeLappe co-edited INCITE: Digital Art and Activism (Peacock Visual Arts) with art historian and curator Dr. Laura Leuzzi in 2023. In 2017 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the Fine Arts.\\nwww.delappe.net. We are grateful to him for the following description of the exhibition:\\nWe Dont Need This Fascist Groove Thang\\nThe world we inhabit is in a state of ongoing upheaval. We have witnessed the onslaught of authoritarianism in the USA, with escalating attacks on civil rights, immigrants, the degradation of freedom of speech and expression, reversals on reproductive autonomy, the erasure of LGBTQIA+ rights, etc. Our collective landscape continues to grow more volatile. We have lived through the global pandemic, witnessed systemic state violence against minorities, witnessed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the brutal genocide in Gaza, intensifying climate catastrophes, and felt the shockwaves of Roe v. Wade being overturned. The ongoing erosion of democratic institutions, and the weaponization of digital technologies have only deepened the sense of instability\\n.\\nIn these struggles, is it possible, even necessary, for artists, technologists, writers, and activists to imagine alternative futures, challenging dominant narratives, and carve out spaces of truth, dissent, and hope?\\nWe Dont Need This Fascist Groove Thang is a call for artworks across all media that respond to our current moment of intersecting crises. We are seeking works that confront, question, and resist the politics of authoritarianism, nationalism, and hate, while also proposing creative strategies for care, solidarity, survival, and beauty.\\nWe welcome submissions in any formvisual art, performance, games, writing, film, sound, installation, digital media, and hybrid practices. This exhibition is rooted in the belief that creativity is both a tool of resistance and a catalyst for change. Lets come together to insist that another world is possibleand that we dont need this fascist groove thang!\\nThe deadline for submissions is midnight on Sunday, November 9 There will be a series of opening receptions, all on the Pioneer Square ArtWalk on First Thursday, December 4, January 1st, and February 5 at CoCAs Pioneer Square location inside the Tashiro Kaplan Building at 114 Third Ave. South, Seattle, 98104.
